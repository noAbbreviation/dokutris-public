  As the name implies, it is a no-gravity, block-building game with Sudoku-esque rules. 
In this game, you place pieces and clear spaces to get points. You lose when you can't fit the given pieces to the board.
The clears in this game are the things that you look for in Sudoku: vertical, horizontal, and blocks of 3-by-3's.

## Placing blocks:
- You select blocks by clicking to a insertable piece to a board. You can tell if a piece does not fit if it has a red outline.
- You place blocks by moving your mouse to a location on the board. Then you click when the board highlights a piece.

## Gaining points:
- You gain points by placing blocks. The bigger the blocks, the higher the score gained.
- You can also gain points by comboing. Clearing consecutively gives you more points than separate clears.
- And finally, you can gain points by clearing more things using a single piece. The setups for multiple clears are difficult, but you can gain the most points by doing so.

  In the current state, you can restart the game by clicking the gamescreen after the game over pops up (it's when the final score shows up).

I'm pretty proud I did this. :smile:
